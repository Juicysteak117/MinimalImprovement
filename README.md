# MinimalImprovement

I don't use GitHub much, but the source code for my theme is here. Not sure how much I'll actually update, other than when stuff breaks of course. It's as complete as I can get it, save for maybe a few things here or there. Message me on Discord at Juicysteak117#1835 if you have any issues, suggestions, or requests. I'm in the BD1 and BD2 server.

Don't expect a change log, but I will list one important change: Changed the theme to import from TheSource so now it only needs to be downloaded once and then it is forever updated. Hooray!
