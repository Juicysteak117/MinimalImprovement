# MinimalImprovement

This theme is designed around minimal mode and dark mode, combining the two to fix the faults in both. The idea is to minimize the wasted space in order to maximize the usable area, while still keeping the feel of basic Discord. 

Message me on Discord at Juicysteak117#1835 if you have any issues, suggestions, or requests. I'm in the BD1 and BD2 server.
